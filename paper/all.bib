abstract={
In software development, bug reports provide crucial information to developers. However, these reports widely differ in their quality. We conducted a survey among developers and users of APACHE, ECLIPSE, and MOZILLA to find out what makes a good bug report.

The analysis of the 466 responses revealed an information mismatch between what developers need and what users supply. Most developers consider steps to reproduce, stack traces, and test cases as helpful, which are at the same time most difficult to provide for users. Such insight is helpful to design new bug tracking tools that guide users at collecting and providing more helpful information.

Our CUEZILLA prototype is such a tool and measures the quality of new bug reports; it also recommends which elements should be added to improve the quality. We trained CUEZILLA on a sample of 289 bug reports, rated by developers as part of the survey. In our experiments, CUEZILLA was able to predict the quality of 31--48% of bug reports accurately.

number={},
pages={495 -504},
abstract={We performed an empirical study to characterize factors that affect which bugs get fixed in Windows Vista and Windows 7, focusing on factors related to bug report edits and relationships between people involved in handling the bug. We found that bugs reported by people with better reputations were more likely to get fixed, as were bugs handled by people on the same team and working in geographical proximity. We reinforce these quantitative results with survey feedback from 358 Microsoft employees who were involved in Windows bugs. Survey respondents also mentioned additional qualitative influences on bug fixing, such as the importance of seniority and interpersonal skills of the bug reporter. Informed by these findings, we built a statistical model to predict the probability that a new bug will be fixed (the first known one, to the best of our knowledge). We trained it on Windows Vista bugs and got a precision of 68% and recall of 64% when predicting Windows 7 bug fixes. Engineers could use such a model to prioritize bugs during triage, to estimate developer workloads, and to decide which bugs should be closed or migrated to future product versions.},

  digital-media-based artifacts, such as software source code and
  Web documents, can provide significant practical benefits.
  Fortunately, these artifacts often have records of their change
  and access history stored in, for example, version control
  databases and Web server access logs.  We describe an approach to
  integrate such atomic traces of authorship and usage to produce
  quantitative estimates of author expertise, the types and sizes of
  user populations, and the quality and veracity of the artifacts
  themselves.  We have incorporated this approach into the Expertise
  Browser, a Web-based tool that displays the relationships among
  authors, users, and artifacts based on the accumulation of
  authorship and usage traces. It can be used to find domain experts
  on a relevant set of artifacts, to compile expertise of an
  individual or organization into a digital resume, and to assess
  the artifacts based on author expertise and types of user
  populations.},
